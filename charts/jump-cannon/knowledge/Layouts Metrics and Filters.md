# Layouts, Metrics, and Filters

Settings groups persistent graph configuration into four tabs:

- **Connection** selects graph-api and summarizes the active graph session.
- **Layout** chooses the simulation engine, starting positions, solver
  parameters, and playback behavior.
- **Appearance** maps graph attributes to size, shape, and color.
- **Camera** controls navigation, fitting, focus, and depth effects.

The command palette's existing Go to Layout, Go to Style, and Go to Camera
actions open Settings on the corresponding tab. Existing Layout, Style, and
Camera values keep their independent localStorage keys, so consolidating the
surface does not reset graph configuration. Workspace layouts from the prior
versions migrate to one Settings panel and preserve the frontmost visible
configuration panel's geometry and state.

Metrics and Filter remain standalone tools: Metrics evaluates the current
result, while Filter can hide non-matches or keep context dimmed. Generate,
Instances, Timeline, and Debug also remain separate because they are active
workflows rather than persistent configuration.

The default renderer runs `graph-layouts` in the browser. Larger or shared work
can use [[Compute]]. Treat layout speed, readability, and interaction latency as
separate measurements under [[Performance Engineering]].
